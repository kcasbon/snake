# Snake

A dupe of the classic game Snake. This game is done 
entirely in C, and generates a game board including walls, fruits 
(cause snake to grow when eaten), and one or more snakes. The game can handle an infinite number of game boards, assuming they adhere to a 
few requirements. The snakes and the game boards are dynamic data structures which update accordingto a set of game rules at each time step. The time in this game is done in a modular way and supports slower or faster timesteps if the player wishes.
